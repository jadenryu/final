1️⃣ Core Purpose

The app is a generative CAD environment powered by an LLM:

Users (or prompts) describe what they want to design in natural language

The AI generates incremental edits to a structured CAD DSL

The system applies, validates, and visualizes those edits in 3D (Three.js)

The result: a working 3D model, fully parametric and feature-aware, without the user manually designing every part

2️⃣ Why This is Valuable

Rapid prototyping: You can go from concept → 3D model in seconds

AI-assisted design: LLM handles creativity, combinations, and repetitive tasks

Incremental and explainable: Each patch/action is tracked (INSERT/REPLACE/DELETE), so the system can show “why” a shape exists

Hackathon-ready: MVP can run entirely in the browser or an Electron app

Composable DSL: Even minimal primitives (cube, cylinder, sketch, extrude, fillet, chamfer, revolve) can generate complex designs when combined by AI

3️⃣ How It Works (High-Level Flow)
User / Prompt
      ↓
LLM generates patch (AT <feature_id> <ACTION> <JSON>)
      ↓
DSL Interpreter applies patch
      ↓
Compiler/Validator checks constraints & geometry
      ↓
If errors → feed back to LLM
Else → Render updated 3D model in Three.js
      ↓
Repeat until no errors or max iterations


DSL: the “code” representing the design, with all primitives, features, and metadata

Patch system: allows incremental edits (like git for CAD)

Renderer: visualizes the 3D model with edges, faces, and features

LLM: thinks in terms of high-level design intent rather than raw vertices

4️⃣ What Users / LLM Can Do

Generate entirely new shapes from natural language

Add features to existing shapes (fillets, chamfers, extrudes)

Modify dimensions or orientations of primitives

Compose sketches, extrudes, revolutions to create complex objects

AI can get creative and generate novel combinations while respecting the DSL rules

5️⃣ Why This Approach is Hackathon-Friendly

Minimal backend requirements: mostly JSON parsing + Three.js rendering

Highly modular: primitives + features + patch system → can expand incrementally

Explainable edits: every feature has a feature_id → easy to track AI reasoning

Immediate visual feedback: shows judges / users the AI’s iterative design decisions

6️⃣ TL;DR (The App in One Sentence)

A web-based AI-CAD system where an LLM incrementally generates, modifies, and validates 3D designs through a structured, feature-aware DSL, producing creative parametric models with full visualization.
