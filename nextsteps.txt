Please complete the following steps.
Write functional, clean code that is scalable and robust.

1. Utilize the xai-sdk library to develop an agent that can translate natural language into code for a CAD application in this syntax
    i. 1️⃣ Patch Behavior
Each patch line follows this format:
AT <feature_id> <ACTION> <JSON_content>
feature_id: unique identifier of the feature
ACTION: INSERT, REPLACE, or DELETE
JSON_content: describes the primitive/feature

2. The agent should be able to take English as the primary source of information and be able to easily convert it into the CAD syntax
shown above. Syntax should be consistent.
