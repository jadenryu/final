Please complete the following steps.
Write functional, clean code that is scalable and robust.

1. First, please use 3JS programming to develop the CAD application. The structure view should be as clean as possible, so please make
the backgorund white instead of navy blue. Additionally, in the chat, the xAI api should not return the format of the shape as it does 
right now, but instead return natural language that guides the user on what happened. the code for the structure is simply a hidden language
used to develop the json to create the structure. 

2. Since we are using 3js, please ensure all stcutures are in three dimensional space. Thus, ensure all buttons for changigng views 
are avaiable.

3. ensure visibility functions work. as of right now, toggling off the visilibty for one shape makes all other shapes invisible.
