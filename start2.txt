1. i want to use RAG (retireval augmented generation) as wlel as xAi's long context models to pull common designs the user uses 
in their projects. please incoporate these features, but keep it subtle. i know i need to input manual info to make this happen. 
pleaes let me know what info i have to put.

2. please allow users to use common onshape tools such as extrude, fillet, cutout, and other features using nlp. allow them to click on 
structures (features) to revela their dimensions and change their size as well. 

3. ensure user messages are shown in the chat as well. 

4. ensure all buttons are functional throughout the program, especially those in the navigation bar (tools) in the cad ai studio.
